# COVID-19 Impact on Airport Traffic Analysis.
## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on airport traffic using Power BI.
The analysis focuses on understanding trends, identifying patterns, and providing actionable insights to stakeholders
for informed decision-making.

## Objectives:
•	To quantify the decline in airport traffic due to COVID-19.

•	To identify the most affected regions and airports.

•	To analyze the correlation between COVID-19 case numbers and airport traffic changes.

•	To provide recommendations for recovery strategies

## Data Sources:
•	Airport traffic data (pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods).

•	COVID-19 case numbers and related public health data.

•	Additional datasets from government reports and industry publications.

## Key Features:

### 1.	Data Integration:
   
•	Combined multiple datasets into a single data model within Power BI.

### 2.	Data Cleaning:
   
•	Handled missing values, duplicates, and standardized data formats using Power Query.

### 3.	Data Modeling:
	
•	Created a robust data model with relationships between tables.

•	Developed calculated columns and measures using DAX.

### 4.	Visualization:

•	Developed interactive and dynamic dashboards.

•	Used various visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, maps, and KPIs.

### 5.	Analysis:
   
•	Analyzed traffic trends over time.

•	Examined the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and airports.

•	Conducted correlation analysis between COVID-19 case spikes and airport traffic declines.

### 6.	Reporting:
   
•	Compiled findings into comprehensive Power BI reports.

•	Provided actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Insights:

•	Significant decline in airport traffic during the peak of the pandemic.

•	Gradual recovery observed in later stages.

•	Certain regions and airports were more severely affected than others.

•	Clear correlation between COVID-19 case numbers and changes in airport traffic.

## Recommendations:

•	Increase marketing efforts and incentives to boost travel in less affected regions.

•	Implement health and safety measures to regain traveler confidence.

•	Optimize staffing and operations based on identified traffic trends.
